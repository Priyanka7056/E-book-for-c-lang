Assigning a value to a variable is very simple. For example, int x=5; here, 5 is assigned to x and this is carried out by the operator =. The equal sign (=) is used for assignment 
and hence, the name assignment operator has been given.
 
Some assignment operators:-

=        *=        /=         %=
+=       -=        <<=        >>=
>>>=     &=        ^=         !=

Consider the following example: k=k+3; in this expression, the variable on the left side of = is repeated on the right. The same can be written as follows:

k+=3;

The operators = and += are called assignment operators. The binary operators which need two operands to their either side are surely have a corresponding assignment operator 
operand = to the left side.

Example:

j*=x+1;

or

j=j*(x+1);


 EXAMPLE CODE 
--------------

void main()

{

int a,b;

clrscr();

printf(“Enter Any Integer either above 5 or below 5 :-”);

scanf(“%d”, &a);

b=(a>5 ? 3 : 4);

printf(“Calculated Value of b is :- %d”,b);

}
