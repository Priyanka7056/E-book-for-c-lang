The logical relationship between the two expressions is tested with logical operators. Using these operators, two expressions can be joined. After checking the conditions, 
it provides logical true (1) or false (0) status. The operands could be constants, variables and expressions.
 
Some logical operators :-

Operator              Description
---------            -------------

&&                   Logical AND
||                   Logical OR
!                    Logical NOT

Following rules can be followed for logical operators:

1. The logical AND (&&) operator provides true result when both expressions are true, otherwise 0.
2. The logical OR (||) operator provides true result when one of the expressions is true, otherwise 0.
3. The logical NOT operator (!) provides 0 if the condition is true, otherwise 1.


EXAMPLE CODE
-------------

void main()

{

clrscr();

printf(“\nCondition : Return Values\n” );

printf(“\n5>3 && 5<10 : %5d”,5>3 && 5<10);

printf(“\n 8>5 || 8<2 : %5d”,8>5 || 8<2);

printf(“\n !(8==8) : %5d”,!(8==8));

}
