In this kind of statement, a number of logical conditions are checked for executing various statements. Here, if the first logical condition is true the compiler executes the 
block followed by first if condition, otherwise it skips that block and checks for next logical condition followed by else-if, if the condition is true the block of statements 
followed by that if condition is executed. The process is continued until a true condition is occurred or an else block is occurred. If all if conditions become false, it 
executes the else block. In the if-else-if ladder statement, the else block may or may not have the else block.

In if-else-if ladder statement we do not have to pair if statements with the else statements that is we do not have to remember the number of braces opened like nested if-else. 
So it is simpler to code than nested if-else and having same effect as nested if-else.

Syntax of if-else-if statement can be given as follows.
---------------------------------------------------------
 
if(condition)

{

statement 1; /*if block*/

statement 2;

}

else if(condition)

{

statement 3; /*second if block*/

statement 4;

}

else if(condition)

{
statement 5; /*third if block*/

statement 6;

}

else

{

statement 7; /*else block*/

statement 8;

}


Following rules can be described for applying nested if-else-if statements:

1. Nested if-else can be chained with one another.
2. If the first if condition is false control passes to else-if block where condition is again checked with the next if statement. This process continues till there is no if statement 
   in the last else block.
3. If one of the if statements satisfies the condition, other nested else-if statement will not be executed.

 EXAMPLE PROGRAM-
------------------

void main()

{

int initial,final,consumed;

float total;

clrscr();

printf(“\n Initial & Final Readings :”);

scanf(“%d %d”, &initial, &final);

consumed = final-initial;

if(consumed>=200 && consumed<=500)

total=consumed * 3.50;

else if(consumed>=100 && consumed<=199)

total= consumed * 2.50;

else if(consumed<100)

total=consumed*1.50;

printf(“Total bill for %d unit is %f”,consumed,total);

getche();

}
