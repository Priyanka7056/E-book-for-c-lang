1. Searching: An array element can be searched. The process of seeking specific elements in an array is called searching.

2. Sorting: Arranging elements in a specific order either in ascending or in descending order is known sorting. Sorting is a very important 
   operation and compulsorily used in database application programs. Let us study the following program, which sorts an array of integers, 
   and store them in another array.


 SAMPLE PROBLEM
----------------

void main()

{

int num[5],j,k,s=0;

clrscr();

printf(“\n Enter five Elements :”);

for(j=0;j<5;j++)

{

  scanf(“%d”,&num[j]);

  s=s+num[j];

}

for(k=0;k<s;k++)

{

  for(j=0;j<5;j++)

  {

    if(num[j]==k)

    printf(“%d”,num[j]);

  }

}

}
