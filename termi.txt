1. Size: Number of elements or capacity to store elements in an array is called its size. It is always mentioned in brackets ([]).

2. Type: Types refer to data type. It decides which type of element is stored in the array. It also instructs the compiler to reserve memory according to data type.

3. Base: The address of the first element (0th) is a base address. The array name itself stores address of the first element.

4. Index: The array name is used to refer to the array element. For example, num[x], num is array name and x is index. The value of x begins from 0 to onwards depending on the 
          size of the array. The index value is always an integer value.

5. Range: Index of an array i.e. value of x varies from lower bound to upper bound while writing or reading elements from an array. For example, in num[100], the range of index 
          is 0 to 99.

6. Word: It indicates the space required for an element. In each memory location, computer can store a data piece. The space occupation varies from machine to machine. If the 
         size of element is more than word (one byte) then it occupies two successive memory locations. The variables of data type int, float, long need more than one byte in 
         memory.
