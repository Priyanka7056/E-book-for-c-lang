The external storage class indicates that the variable has been defined at other place other than the place where it is declared. It can be declared in another source file. 
The variable declaration generally appears before main() and use of keyword extern is optional. Initialization cannot be done because its value is defined in another source file. 
Memory is not allotted in the source program, and it is allotted, where it is defined.

The variables that are available to all the functions, i.e. from entire program, can be accessed. The variables are called external or global variables. External variables are 
declared outside the function body. In case, in a program both external and auto variables are declared with the same name, the first priority is given to the auto variable. 
In this case, external variable is hidden. If we declare external variables in the program, there is no need to pass these variables to other function. The compiler does not 
allocate memory for these variables. It is already allocated for it in another module where it is declared as a global variable.
