We can also use loop within loops. In nested for loops one or more for statements are included in the body of the loop. In other words C allows multiple for loops in nested 
forms. The numbers of iterations in this type of structure will be equal to the number of iteration in the outer loop multiplied by the number of iterations in the inner 
loop. Given below examples are based on the nested for loops.


 SAMPLE CODE
-------------

int i,j,n,k;
	scanf("%d",&n);
	printf("\n");
	for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
	{
		for(j=n;j>i;j--)
		{
			printf(" ");
		}
		for(k=1;k<=i;k++)
		{
		   printf("*");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
