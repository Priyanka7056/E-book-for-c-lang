C supports a set of bitwise operators for bit manipulation as listed in Table 3.8. C supports six bit operators. These operators can operate only on integer operands such as 
int, char, short, long.

 Operators       Meaning
-----------     ---------

>>              Right Shift
<<              Left Shift
^               Bitwise XOR
~               One's complement
&               Bitwise AND
|               Bitwise OR


EXAMPLE CODE
-------------

void main()

{

int x,y;

clrscr();

printf(“Read The Integer from keyboard (x) :-”);

scanf(“%d”, &x);

x>>=2;

y=x;

printf(“The Right shifted data is = %d”,y);

}
