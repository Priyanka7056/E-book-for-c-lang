The static variable may be of an internal or external type, depending where it is declared. If declared outside the function body, it will be static global. In case, declared 
in the body or block, it will be an auto variable. When a variable is declared as static, its garbage value is removed and initialized to NULL value. The contents stored in 
these variables remain constant throughout the program execution. A static variable is initialized only once; it is never reinitialized. The value of the static variable 
persists at each call and the last change made in the value of the static variable remains throughout the program execution. Using this property of the static variable, we 
can count how many times a function was called.
