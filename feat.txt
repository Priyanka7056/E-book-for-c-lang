1. Pointers are a fundamental tool in developing code in C.

2. Pointers save the memory space.

3. The memory is accessed efficiently with the pointers. The pointer assigns the memory space and also releases it. Pointers are used to allocate memory dynamically.


4. Pointers are used with data structures. They are useful for representing two-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

5. Access elements of an array of any data type irrespective of its subscript range.

6. Pointers are used for file handling.

7. They allow us to create linked lists and other algorithmically oriented data structures.

8. Execution time with pointer is faster because data is manipulated with the address.
