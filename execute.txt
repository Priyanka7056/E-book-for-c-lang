A C program must go through various phases such as creating a program with editor, execution of preprocessor program, compilation, linking, loading and executing the 
program. The following steps are essential in C when a program is to be executed in MS-DOS mode:

1. Creation of a Program: The program should be written in C editor. The file name does not necessarily include extension ‘.C’. The default extension is ‘.C’. 
                          The user can also specify his/her own extension. The C program includes preprocessor directives.

2. Execution of a Preprocessor Program: After writing a program with C editor the programmer has to compile the program with the command (Alt-C). The preprocessor 
                                        program executes first automatically before the compilation of the program. A programmer can include other files in the 
                                        current file. Inclusion of other files is done initially in the preprocessor section.

3. Compilation and Linking of a Program: The source program contains statements that are to be translated into object codes. These object codes are suitable for 
                                         execution by the computer. If a program contains errors the programmer should correct them. If there is no error in the 
                                         program, compilation proceeds and translated program is stored in another file with the same file name with extension ‘.obj’. 
                                         This object file is stored on the secondary storage device such as a disc.

4. Executing the Program: After the compilation the executable object code will be loaded in the computer’s main memory and the program is executed. The loader performs
                          this function. All the above steps/phases of C program can be performed using menu options of the editor.
