The declaration of variables should be done in declaration part of the program. The variable must be declared before they are used in the program. Declaration ensures the following 
two things: 
(i) compiler obtains the variable name and 
(ii) it tells to the compiler data type of the variable being declared and helps in allocating the memory. 

The variable can also be declared before main() such variables are called external variables.

 The syntax of declaring a variable is as follows.

Syntax:

Data_type variable_name;

Example:

int age;

char m;

float s;

double k;

int a,b,c;

The int, char, float and double are keywords to represent data types. Commas separate the variables, in case variables are more than one.

Variables declared can be assigned or initialized using assignment operator ‘=’. The declaration and initialization can also be done in the same line.

Syntax:

variable_name = constant;

or

data_type variable_name= constant;

Example:

x=5; where x is an integer variable.

Example:

int y=4;

Example:

int x,y,z;         /* Declaration of variables */

The third example as cited above for declaration of variables is also a valid statement.
