The syntax of do-while loop in C is as follows.

do

{

statement/s;

}

while(condition);

The difference between the while and do-while loop is the place where the condition is to be tested. In the while loops the condition is tested following the while statement, 
and then the body gets executed, whereas in the do-while the condition is checked at the end of the loop. The do-while loop will execute at least one time even if the condition 
is false initially. The do-while loop executes until the condition becomes false.

1       | Condition is specified at the top.  |  Condition is mentioned at the bottom.
        |                                     |
2       | Body statement/s is/are executed    |  Body statement/s executes even when 
        | when condition is satisfied.        |  the condition is false.  
        |                                     |
3       | No brackets for a single statement. |  Brackets are essential even when a 
        |                                     |  single statement exits.
