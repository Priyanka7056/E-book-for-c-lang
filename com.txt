Comma Operator (,): The comma operator is used to separate two or more expressions. The comma operator has the lowest priority among all the operators. It is not essential 
to enclose the expressions with comma operators within the parentheses. For example, the following statements are valid.

Example:
a=2,b=4,c=a+b;

Conditional Operator (?): The conditional operator contains condition followed by two statements or values. The condition operator is also called the ternary operator. If the 
condition is true, the first statement is executed, otherwise the second statement is executed.
Conditional operators (?) and (:) are sometimes called ternary operators because they take three arguments. The syntax of the conditional operator is as follows:

Syntax:

Condition ? (expression1) : (expression2);

Two expressions are separated by a colon. If the condition is true expression 1 gets evaluated, otherwise expression 2 gets evaluated. The condition is always written before 
the ? mark.
