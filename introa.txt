An array is a very popular and useful data structure used to store data elements in successive memory locations. More than one element is stored in a sequence, so it is also 
called a composite data structure. An array is a linear and homogeneous data structure. An array permits homogeneous data. It means that similar types of elements are stored 
contiguously in the memory and that too under one variable name. It can be combined with a non-homogeneous structure, and a complex data structure can be created. We know 
that an array of structure objects can also be useful. An array can be declared of any standard or custom data type. The array of character (strings) type works somewhat 
differently from an array of integers, floating numbers.
