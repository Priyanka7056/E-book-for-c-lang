A programmer while writing a program should follow the following rules:

1. Every program should have main() function.

2. C statements should be terminated by a semi-colon. At some places, a comma operator is permitted. If only a semi-colon is placed it is treated as a statement.

3. An unessential semi-colon if placed by the programmer is treated as an empty statement.

4. All statements should be written in lowercase letters. Generally, uppercase letters are used only for symbolic constants.

5. Blank spaces may be inserted between the words. This leads to improvement in the readability of the statements. However, this is not applicable while declaring
   a variable, keyword, constant and function.

6. It is not necessary to fix the position of statement in the program; i.e. a programmer can write the statement anywhere between the two braces following the 
   declaration part. The user can also write one or more statements in one line separating them with a semi-colon (;). Hence, it is often called a free-form language.

7. The opening and closing braces should be balanced, i.e. if opening braces are four; closing braces should also be four.
