The static external variable can be accessed as external variables only in the file in which they are defined. No other file can access the static external variables that are 
defined in another file.

Note: The difference between an ordinary external variable and a static external variable is of scope. An ordinary external variable is visible to all functions in the file 
      and can be used by functions in other files. A static external variable is visible only to functions in its own file and below the point of definition.
