Depending on arguments present, the return value sends the result back to the calling function. Based on this, the functions are divided into four types.

1. Without arguments and return values-
  
   (a) Data is neither passed through the calling function nor sent back from the called function.
   (b) There is no data transfer between calling and called functions.
   (c) The function is only executed and nothing is obtained.
   (d) If such functions are used to perform any operation, they act independently. They read data values and print result in the same block.
   (e) Such functions may be useful to print some message, draw a line or spilt the line.

2. With arguments but without return values-

   (a) In the above functions, arguments are passed through the calling function. The called function operates on the values. But no result is sent back
   (b) Such functions are partly dependent on the calling function. The result obtained is utilized by the called function and there is no gain to the main().

3. With arguments and return values-

   (a) In the above example, the copy of the actual argument is passed to the formal argument, i.e. the value of ‘x’ is assigned to ‘y’.
   (b) The return statement returns the incremented value of ‘y’. The returned value is collected by ‘z’.
   (c) Here, data is transferred between calling and called functions, i.e. communication between functions is made.

4. Without arguments and but with return values-

   (a) In the above type of function, no argument(s) is passed through the main() function. But the called function returns values.
   (b) The called function is independent. It reads values from keyboard or generates from initialization and returns the values.
   (c) Here, both the calling and called functions partly communicate with each other.
