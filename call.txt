There are two ways in which we can pass arguments to the function.:-

1. Call by value: In this type, the value of actual arguments is passed to the formal arguments and operation is done on the formal arguments. Any change in the formal argument 
                  made does not affect the actual arguments because formal arguments are the photocopy of the actual argument. Hence, when a function is called by the call by 
                  value method, it does not affect the actual contents of the arguments. Changes made in the formal arguments are local to the block of the called function. 
                  Once control returns back to the calling function, changes made vanish. The example given below illustrates the use of call by value.

2. Call by reference: In this type, instead of passing values, addresses (reference) are passed. Function operates on addresses rather than values. Here, the formal arguments 
                      are pointers to the actual argument. In this type, formal arguments point to the actual argument. Hence, changes made in the argument are permanent. 
                      The example given below illustrates the use of call by value.
