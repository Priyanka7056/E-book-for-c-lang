Variables are the basic objects manipulated in a program. Declaration gives an introduction of variable to compiler and its properties like scope, range of values and memory 
required for storage. A variable is used to store values. It has memory location and can store single value at a time.

When a program is executed, many operations are carried out on the data. The data types are integers, real or character constants. The data is stored in the memory, and at the 
time of execution it is fetched for carrying out different operations on it.

A variable is a data name used for storing a data value. Its value may be changed during the program execution. The variable value keeps on changing during the execution of the 
program. In other words, a variable can be assigned different values at different times during the program execution. A variable name may be declared based on the meaning of the 
operation. Variable names are made up of letters and digits.
