The keywords signed, unsigned, short and long are type modifiers. A type modifier changes the meaning of basic data type and produces a new data type. Each of these type modifiers 
is applicable to the basic data type int. The modifiers signed and unsigned are also applicable to the type char. The long type modifier can be applicable to double type.

Example:

long l;         /* int data type is applied */

int s;         /* signed is default */

unsigned long int;         /* int keyword is optional */
