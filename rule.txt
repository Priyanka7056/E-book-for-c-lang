1. A variable must begin with a character or an underscore without spaces. The underscore is treated as one type of character. It is very useful to increase readability of 
   variables having long names. It is advised that the variable names should not start with underscore because library routines mostly use such variable names.

2. The length of the variable varies from compiler to compiler. Generally, most of the compilers support eight characters excluding extension. However, the ANSI standard recognizes 
   the maximum length of a variable up to 31 characters. Names of functions and external variables length may be less than 31 because external names may be used by assemblers and 
   loaders over which language has no control. For external names, the variable names should be of six characters and in single case.

3. The variable should not be a C keyword.

4. The variable names may be a combination of uppercase and lowercase characters. For example, suM and sum are not the same. The traditional practice is to use lowercase characters 
   for variable names and uppercase letters for symbolic constants.

5. The variable name should not start with a digit.

6. Blanks and commas are not permitted within a variable name.
