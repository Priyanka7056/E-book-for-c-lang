A compiler designer prescribes rules for making a program using statements. The smallest unit in a program/statement is called a token. The compiler identifies them as tokens.

The tokens are as follows:

1. Keywords: Key words are reserved by the compiler. There are 32 keywords (ANSI Standard).
2. Variables: These are user defined. Any number of variables can be defined.
3. Constants: Constants are assigned to variables.
4. Operators: Operators are of different types and are used in expressions.
5. Special Characters: These characters are used in different declarations in C.
6. Strings: A sequence of characters.
