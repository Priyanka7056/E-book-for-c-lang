Array elements are stored contiguously in sequence one after the other. The elements of an array are just arranged in one-dimension. They can be shown in a row or column. 
Single subscript will be used in one-dimensional array to represent its elements.

An example of initialization of an array: - int a[5]; in this initialization of an array is done. The type of variable is integer; its variable name is a and 5 is the size 
of the array.

The elements of the integer array a[5] are stored in contiguous memory locations. It is assumed that the starting memory location is 2000. Each integer element requires 
2 bytes. Hence, subsequent element appears after the gap of two locations.

Similarly, the elements of arrays of any data type are stored in contiguous memory location. The only difference is that the number of locations is different for different 
data types.

Character arrays are called strings. There is a slight difference between an integer array and character array. In character array, NULL (‘\0’) character is automatically 
added at the end, whereas in integer or other types of arrays, no null/character is placed at the end.

The NULL character acts as the end of the character array. By using this NULL character compiler detects the end of the character array. When compiler reads the NULL 
character ‘\0’, there is end of character array.

Note: Detailed information about strings (character array) is given in another chapter ‘Strings.’ 


 SAMPLE PROBLEM
----------------

void main()

{

int sumo=0,sume=0,i=0,odd[5],even[5],a=-1,b=-1;

clrscr();

for (i=1;i<=10;i++)

{

  if(i%2==0)

  even[++a]=i;

  else

  odd[++b]=i;

}

printf(“\n\tEven \t\tOdd”);

for(i=0;i<5;i++)

{

  printf(“\n\t %d\t\t %d”,even[i],odd[i]);

  sume=sume+even[i];

  sumo=sumo+odd[i];

}

printf(“\n\t=====================\n”);

printf(“Addition: %d %14d”,sume,sumo);

}
