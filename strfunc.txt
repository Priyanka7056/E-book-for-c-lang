C compiler supports a large number of string handling library functions. Table below provides the list of many frequently used functions and their description. The header file 
string.h is to be initialized whenever standard library function is used. In other words, the string handling functions are given in string.h.

 Functions                             Description
------------            -----------------------------------------------

strlen()                   Determines the length of a string.

strcpy()                   Copies a string from the source to destination.

strncpy()                  Copies characters of a string to another string up to the specified length.

strcmp()                   Compares characters of two strings (function discriminates between small and capital letters)

stricmp()                  Compares two strings (function does not discriminate between the small and capital letters).

strncmp()                  Compares characters of two strings up to the specified length.

strnicmp()                 Compares characters of two strings up to the specified length. Ignores case.

strlwr()                   Converts uppercase characters of a string to lowercase.

strupr()                   Converts lowercase characters of a string to uppercase.



SAMPLE PROGRAM
---------------

# include <string.h>

void main()

{

char text[20];

int len;

clrscr();

printf(“Type Text Below.\n”);

gets(text);

len=strlen(text);

printf(“Length of String =%d”,len);

}
