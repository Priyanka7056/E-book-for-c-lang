The plain characters are straightforward and are used to write data on the screen. On the other hand, the conversion specification retrieves arguments from the list of arguments 
and apply different formatting to them. All format specification starts with % and a format specification letter after this symbol. It indicates the type of data and its format. 
In case the format string does not match the corresponding variable, the result will not be correct.

1. Flags: Flags are used for output justification, numeric signs, decimal points, trailing zeros. The flag (-) left justifies the result. If it is not given, the default is right 
          justification. The plus (+) signed conversion result always starts with a plus (+) or a minus (-) sign.

2. Width specifier : It sets the minimum field width for an output value. Width can be specified through a decimal point or using an asterisk ‘*’.

3. Precision specifiers: Precise results on the screen can be obtained. The precision specifier always starts with a period or a dot in order to separate it from any preceding 
                         width specifiers.
