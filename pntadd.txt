The theory of the pointer is not complicated. The computer memory is made by the semi-conductor technology. Memory comprises binary cells. Each cell has a capacity to store 
a bit either 0 or 1. Byte means a unit of 8 bits. Every such byte has a unique memory address

When a variable of any data type is declared, memory according to its data type is reserved.

For example:

int x,y;

char c;

Memory locations are reserved for the variables x, y and c. For an integer variable two bytes each and for character variable one byte is reserved. The locations 65550 and 
65551 are used to store x, and 65552 and 65553 are used to store y and so on. The starting address for x is 65550 and for y, it is 65552. The character needs only one byte 
and its location shown in Figure 9.3 is 65554.
