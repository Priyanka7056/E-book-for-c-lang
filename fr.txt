The for loop allows to execute a set of instructions until a certain condition is satisfied. Condition may be predefined or open-ended.

The for statement contains three expressions which are separated by semi-colons. Following actions are to be performed in the three expressions.

Syntax of for loop-
-------------------

for(initialize counter; test condition; re-evaluation parameter)

{

statement1;

statement2;

}

1. The initialize counter sets to an initial value. This statement is executed only once.

2. The test condition is a relational expression, that determines the number of iterations desired or determines when to exit from the loop. The ‘for’ loop continues to execute as 
   long as conditional test is satisfied. When the condition becomes false the control of the program exits from the body of the ‘for’ loop and executes next statement after the 
   body of the loop.
3. The re-evaluation parameter decides how to make changes in the loop (increment or decrement operations are to be used quite often). The body of the loop may contain either a 
   single statement or multiple statements. In case, there is only one statement after the for loop, braces may not be necessary. In such a case, only one statement is executed 
   till the condition is satisfied. It is good practice to use braces even for single statement following the for loop.


 EXAMPLE CODE
--------------

void main()

{

int i;

clrscr();

for(i=1;i<=5;i++)

printf(“\n Number: %5d it’s Square: %5d”,i,i*i);

}
