C uses the keyword if to execute a set of command lines or one command line when the logical condition is true. It has only one option. The sets of command lines are executed 
only when the logical condition is true.

The if statement contains an expression which is evaluated. If the expression is true it returns 1, otherwise 0. The statement is executed when the condition is true. In case 
the condition is false, the compiler skips the lines within the if block. The condition is always enclosed within a pair of ­parentheses. The conditional statements should not 
be terminated with semi-colons (;). The statements following the if statement are normally enclosed within curly braces. The curly braces indicate the scope of the if statement. 
The default scope is one statement. But it is good practice to use curly braces even if a single statement is used following the if condition.
