A character is a part of a word, sentence or paragraph. By using different characters, words, expressions and statements can be created on the basis of the requirement. This 
creation depends upon the computer on which a program runs.

A character is represented by any alphabets in lowercase or uppercase, digits or special characters.

Valid C character set which are as follows: (i) Letters (ii)Digits (iii) White Spaces & Escape Sequences and (iv) Special Characters. As C character set consists of escape 
sequences so each escape sequence begins with back slash (\) and it represents a single character. Any character can be represented as character constant using escape sequence.

The special characters listed are represented in the computer by numeric values. The C characters are assigned unique codes. There are many character codes used in 
the computer system. The widely and standard codes used in computer are ASCII and EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code).

ASCII Code: ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is the code of two types. One uses 7 bits and other uses 8 bits. The 7-bit code represents 
            128 different characters and the 8-bit code represents 256 characters. For example, the character A is represented in 7-bit code as 10000012(decimal 65). Refer 
            to Appendix A for the list of characters and their equivalent number.
